# LeetCode

Hello, here you can find my solutions for LeetCode problems.
I started again on 18 of November 2022 and so far I solved 5 problems. And yep, I am too lazy to update this number.

## My roadmap:
- [x] Binary Search I (23 tasks; done on 29 of November)
- [ ] Binary Search II (? tasks)
- [ ] Binary Search III (? tasks)

## Cheatsheet

### List API
- .Sort() // asc order

### Math

#### arithmetic progression
- an = a1 + d *(n-1);
- sn = ((a1 + an)/2)*n
